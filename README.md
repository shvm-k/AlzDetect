Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that impacts memory, thinking, and behavior. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and management. This project utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to classify MRI scans into four categories:  
- **Non-Demented**  
- **Mild Demented**  
- **Moderate Demented**  
- **Very Mild Demented**  

The goal is to assist in early diagnosis using MRI data, thus contributing to the healthcare domain.

### üìÇ **Dataset Overview**

The dataset contains MRI brain scans labeled into the above four categories. Key details about the dataset:  
- **Source**: Publicly available dataset [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninadaithal/imagesoasis).  
- **Preprocessing**: Images are resized to a uniform dimension, normalized, and their labels are one-hot encoded.  
- **Split**: Divided into training, validation, and test sets.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation**

#### **Preprocessing**  
- Images are resized to 300x300 pixels.  
- Pixel values are normalized to improve model convergence.  
- Labels are one-hot encoded for multi-class classification.

#### **Data Augmentation**  
To enhance the model's ability to generalize, the following augmentations are applied:  
- Random rotation  
- Zoom  
- Horizontal and vertical flipping  
- Brightness variations

Below is an example of augmented training data:

### üß† **Model Architecture**  
The project uses **EfficientNetB0** as the base model, fine-tuned for Alzheimer's classification. Key layers added include:  
- **Global Average Pooling** for feature extraction.  
- **Dense Layers** with ReLU activation for classification.  
- **Softmax Output Layer** for predicting probabilities across four classes.

---

### üèãÔ∏è **Training**  
The model is trained using the **categorical crossentropy loss** function with the Adam optimizer. Early stopping and learning rate reduction techniques are employed to avoid overfitting and improve convergence.

### üêû **Known Issues**  
- [ ] Error in `model.fit`: Target and output shape mismatch.  
- [ ] Fuzzy logic not yet implemented in the evaluation phase.
